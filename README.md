### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Trang Nguyen, but you can call me Emma or Em :smile: and I'm a junior and CS major at Mount Holyoke College. 

I love coding and riding the ups and downs of the software development process. I also find great joy in working and bonding with other programmers over solving tech problems, and learning and offering ideas within a group setting. These days, you can often find me coding with React and Node or doing text analysis!
